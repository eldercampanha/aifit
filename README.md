## About the App ðŸ“±

This app is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize personal styling by harnessing the power of Google's Gemini AI technology. The core functionality of the app allows users to take pictures of their wardrobe items along with a photo of themselves. The app then uses Gemini AI to experiment with different clothing combinations, providing users with suggestions on what to wear for various occasions. This not only offers a fun and interactive way to explore fashion choices but also helps users visualize how different outfits will look on them.
